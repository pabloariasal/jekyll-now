Hola! My name is Pablo and I've been writing software for about seven years. 
My daily life requires that I remain curious; in a constant state of learning. 
This blog studies an array of interesting topics that I have stumbled across in my journey as a software engineer. 
Even though the main goal is to document for my future reference, my hope is that you may learn one thing or two. 
My main topics of interest are computer vision, machine learning and IT security.
I'm currently based in Munich, Germany. 

I love football, beer and dogs, specially my old buddy Nova:

He had a little daughter some years ago, this is Terra when she was a few weeks old:

Feel free to hit me up via email or instagram in case you need more newfie pictures or wanna chat about stuff.

And btw I use arch linux.
