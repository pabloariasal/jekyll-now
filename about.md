Hola! My name is Pablo and I've been writing software for about seven years. 
My daily life requires that I remain a pupil, always curious and in constant state of learning.
This blog documents an array of interesting topics that stumble accross in my journey as a software engineer. 
Even though my main goal is to teach myself, my hope is that you may take one thing or two. 
My main topics of interest are computer vision, machine learning and IT security.

I love dogs and football. This is my dog Nova:

Feel free to hit me up via email or instagram.

And btw I use arch linux.
